# papertapetext
A quick program to generate man readable text on a punched paper tape.


This is a Unix utility that as standard input takes the file to print on the paper tape. As output it gives a file that contains data to be punched to the paper tape.

# how it was done

Pontus helped my taking photos of a number of punched paper tapes from DEC.

Then I compiled all patterns on a page and figured out the encoding of each character.
